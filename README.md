# Best Community Service Prototype

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This was created in about a 3 week span as a class project. It utilizes React and React-Bootstrap components.
There is some functionality, and there are some pages that show nothing. 

## Available Functionality

Can login,create an account, signout feautures. 
You can use just a dummy email like root@gmail.com. It doesnt need to be existing email, just needs the format.

As an employee, you can create seminars, and they'll show in the Classes list.

You can 'make a donation' using email and credit card information. Again, nothing is saved and you can use dummy data.
